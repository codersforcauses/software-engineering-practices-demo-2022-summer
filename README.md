# Software Engineering Practices Demo
This repository is about demonstrating the usual workflow of software engineers in the real-world.

There are usually a couple parts:

- Issues / tickets
- Kanban board (todo, in progress, review)
- Pull Requests
- Code Reviews

## Instruction
Do the following:

1. Look at the github issues
2. Assign yourself an issue
3. Create a branch with the following format `{Issue Number}-{Issue Name}`. `git checkout -b {Issue Number}-{Issue Name}`
4. Create the change to satisfy or complete the github issue
5. Commit (package) the change `git commit -m "{insert message here}"` and push `git push`.
6. Create a pull request and request for a reviewer from CFC peeps
